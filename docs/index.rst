   HISTORY

The core GroupServer_ CSS code implements a style known as
*Colour is for happy people*. It is **deliberately** devoid of
colour: a monochrome palette of black, white and greys is
used. This means that everything has to rely on :doc:`layout`
(alignment and proximity), shape and typography to make
sense. The typography is supported by some glyph :doc:`icons`.

To this core layout different colourful skins can be added. See
`gs.skin.green`_ and `gs.skin.blue`_ for two examples.
