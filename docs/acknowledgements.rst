The `Twitter Bootstrap`_ CSS is pasted at the start of the
GroupServer file to eliminate the need for an HTTP request. It is
licenced under the `Apache License, Version 2.0`_. The included
CSS is a modified version of `Bootstrap 2.3.0`_. Refer to the
`documentation for 2.3.2`_ to learn more. Do note that the
following components have been removed from the included version
of Bootstrap:

* The grid system
* Responsive utility classes

The :doc:`icons` were taken from two glyph-fonts:

* `Font Awesome`_ by Dave Gandy provided the text-editing icons,
  the devices, the spinner, and the pin-icon. It is licenced
  under the `CC BY 3.0 license`_.
* Entypo_ by Daniel Bruce provided most of the icons. It is
  licenced under the `CC BY-SA 3.0 license`_.

The `IcoMoon`_ App, by Keyamoon, was used to crate the font-files.
