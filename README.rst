Introduction
============

The core GroupServer_ CSS code implements a style known as
"Colour is for Happy People". It is *deliberately* devoid of
colour: just black, white and greys are used. This means that
everything has to rely on layout (alignment and proximity),
shape and typography to make sense. The typography is supported
by some glyph icons.

To this core layout different colourful skins can be added. See
`gs.skin.green`_ and `gs.skin.blue`_ for two examples.
